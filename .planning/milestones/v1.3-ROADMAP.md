## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- NSIS config at build.nsis top-level (not build.win.nsis) — electron-builder v26 requirement
- oneClick:false allows users to choose installation directory
- perMachine:false for per-user installation (no admin required)
- Unsigned installer acceptable for local/internal distribution
- Maximum compression for smaller installer size

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed electron-builder win.copyright validation error (moved to top-level)
- Fixed NSIS configuration placement (build.nsis not build.win.nsis)
- Fixed winCodeSign cache extraction failure (Windows symlink limitation)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Code signing certificate (would eliminate SmartScreen warning)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Unsigned installer shows SmartScreen warning on first run
- latest.yml filename discrepancy (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)

**Deliverable:**
`dist/Speed Reader Setup 1.0.0.exe` (104MB)
