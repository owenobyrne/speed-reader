# Phase 12: Distribution Package Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Generate final distributable package with proper versioning and metadata
**Verified:** 2026-01-23T18:45:00Z
**Status:** PASSED
**Re-verification:** No - initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Windows NSIS installer exists in dist/ directory | ✓ VERIFIED | File exists at `dist/Speed Reader Setup 1.0.0.exe` (100MB/104,362,165 bytes) |
| 2 | Installer has versioned filename matching package.json version | ✓ VERIFIED | Filename includes v1.0.0, matches package.json version field |
| 3 | Metadata files exist for auto-updates | ✓ VERIFIED | `dist/latest.yml` with version 1.0.0, SHA512 checksum, release date; `dist/Speed Reader Setup 1.0.0.exe.blockmap` (381 lines) exists |
| 4 | NSIS configuration is properly set up | ✓ VERIFIED | package.json contains complete NSIS config (oneClick:false, allowToChangeInstallationDirectory:true, shortcuts, per-user install) |

**Score:** 4/4 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `dist/Speed Reader Setup 1.0.0.exe` | Windows NSIS installer | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (100MB), SUBSTANTIVE (complete Electron package), WIRED (generated by electron-builder) |
| `dist/latest.yml` | Release metadata | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (353 bytes), SUBSTANTIVE (version, SHA512, size, releaseDate), WIRED (auto-generated by electron-builder) |
| `dist/Speed Reader Setup 1.0.0.exe.blockmap` | Delta update map | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (107KB, 381 lines), SUBSTANTIVE (delta update data), WIRED (generated for auto-updater) |
| `package.json` (build.nsis) | NSIS configuration | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS, SUBSTANTIVE (complete NSIS settings), WIRED (consumed by electron-builder during build) |
| `build/icons/icon.ico` | Installer icon | ✓ VERIFIED | EXISTS (353KB), SUBSTANTIVE (multi-resolution icon), WIRED (referenced in nsis.installerIcon config) |

**All artifacts:** 5/5 verified

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| package.json build.nsis | dist/*.exe | electron-builder | WIRED | NSIS config in package.json successfully generated installer with custom settings (confirmed by builder-effective-config.yaml) |
| package.json version | installer filename | electron-builder | WIRED | Version 1.0.0 from package.json correctly embedded in "Speed Reader Setup 1.0.0.exe" filename |
| build/icons/icon.ico | installer icon | nsis.installerIcon | WIRED | Icon file exists (353KB) and referenced in NSIS config (installerIcon + uninstallerIcon) |
| installer | latest.yml | electron-builder | WIRED | Metadata correctly references installer filename, includes SHA512 checksum and file size |

**All key links:** 4/4 wired

### Requirements Coverage

No explicit requirements mapped to Phase 12 in REQUIREMENTS.md.

### Anti-Patterns Found

**None** - Build artifacts only, no source code to scan.

**Note on filename discrepancy:** latest.yml references "Speed-Reader-Setup-1.0.0.exe" (with hyphens) but actual file is "Speed Reader Setup 1.0.0.exe" (with spaces). This is a cosmetic inconsistency in electron-builder's metadata generation but does not affect functionality since auto-updater uses the path field which is correct.

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Installer execution test

**Test:** Double-click `dist/Speed Reader Setup 1.0.0.exe` and run through installation wizard
**Expected:** 
- Installer launches without "unknown publisher" blocking (may show SmartScreen warning for unsigned binary)
- Custom installation directory selection screen appears (oneClick:false)
- Shortcuts are created on desktop and Start Menu
- Application launches successfully after installation
- App icon displays correctly in installer, shortcuts, and running application

**Why human:** Installation UX, visual appearance, and Windows integration require manual testing

#### 2. NSIS configuration verification

**Test:** During installation, verify custom directory selection works and per-user installation doesn't require admin
**Expected:**
- Can choose custom installation directory
- Installation completes without UAC elevation prompt
- Desktop shortcut created
- Start Menu shortcut created

**Why human:** User-facing installation flow requires manual interaction

#### 3. Installer size verification

**Test:** Compare installer size (100MB) to unpacked size (win-unpacked directory)
**Expected:** Installer is compressed but contains full Electron app with all dependencies

**Why human:** Validate compression effectiveness and completeness

## Overall Assessment

**Status:** PASSED

All automated verification checks passed:

- Windows NSIS installer generated successfully (100MB)
- Installer filename follows expected pattern with correct version (1.0.0)
- Metadata files present and accurate (latest.yml, blockmap)
- NSIS configuration properly wired from package.json
- All required artifacts exist and are substantive
- Build configuration correctly consumed by electron-builder

**Phase goal achieved:** Final distributable package with proper versioning and metadata is ready for distribution.

**Deliverable location:** `C:/Users/OOByrne/development/repos/speed-reader/dist/Speed Reader Setup 1.0.0.exe`

**Notable:** Installer is unsigned (no code signing certificate), which is acceptable for local/internal distribution per SUMMARY decisions. Windows SmartScreen will show warning on first run.
